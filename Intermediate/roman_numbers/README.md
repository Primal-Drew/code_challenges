# Roman Numerals Encoder
## DESCRIPTION
THE [LINK](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51b62bf6a9c58071c600001b/train/c).

Create a function taking a positive integer between 1 and 3999 (both included) as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. 

```Examples```
1. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered:
1000=M 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 
2. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 
3. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.


## LEARNING RESOURCE:
1. Using `asprintf()` in the clever_alt
2. Check the clever alt section.

## My Approach
    I took the Table Matching approach for this one.
